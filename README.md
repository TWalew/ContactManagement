# ContactManagement
 Contact management system task for Invelop
 
 Hey, guys wellcome to my application. =)

 To run the app you'll need to do some initial setup first.

 We can start with the database:

 1. You need to have SQL Server Management Studio or some other server studio depending on what database you want to       use. Keep in mind if using other database you'll also need to change the connection string.
 1.1 If you want to stick with SQL Server you can open SSMS and run the first query to create the database:
 ```diff
- text in red
+ text in green
! text in orange
# text in gray
@@ text in purple (and bold)@@
```
